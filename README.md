# React Big Refersher (RBR ðŸ˜Ž)

I have worked on multiple react projects, JS, TS, and with multiple tools (Tailwind, emotion, MUI4, MUI5, styled components,Webpack, and others).
To be honest I don't even remmber most of the tools I used, I'd just look up my resume for that ðŸ˜† but the point is that I had to take couple of freelancing projects away from react (Vue, Salesforce, LWC, and more).

Being back here on React project feels a bit rusty, so in order to get back some of the glory days and even better, coming back to build a personal react project with all the knowledge of React I can remmber, and accumlated over the years.

Nothing Huge, just starting slow, one component at a time and see where it goes, it's really about implementing the basic concepts of `React` as simple as possible, then maybe level it up a notch.

My other repos include lots of `React` and more tools that I have discovered and used, but now it's time to <strong>REFRESH!</strong>

## The Plan: (for now ðŸ˜¶):

> ### Create a Todo list where users can:

> #### Phase 1

-   Create Todo Item
-   View created items in a list
-   Add or remove items
    > #### Phase 2
-   Add due date for each todo item. (do validation, should be in the future)
-   Order todos list via date or alphabetical (one has to be default sort)
-   Order todos list via date or alphabetical (one has to be default sort)

> #### Phase 3

-   Store items in local storage
-   GET /POST items to a server/endpoint

> #### Phase 4

-   Add Google login/auth
-   Test Performance [here](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

> #### Phase 5

-   Add pomodro timer into the app
-   user can track time, after certain amount of time passes, an alarm should trigger with alert box.
-   time options could be custom input with 3 buttons 15, 30 and 45 mins.
-   Should be a break button for 5 and 15 mins.
    -Custom input for break
    -Pause button that stops time either on break or work time.
-   A list of time tracked should show below the timer, how many intervals completed successfuly, breaks, and any date that might fit?

> #### Phase 6

-   Add Weather forecast data from [open weather api](https://openweathermap.org/api) ( as a side gadget)
-   Allow user to choose city or country for weather forecast data (based on api endpoints/docs)

> #### Phase 7

-   Access user location to forecast weather automatically.

> #### Phase 8

-   Wanna display `Phase 5` data on a graph?

> #### Phase 9 (hmmmmmm.....)

-   change the UI?

Now that's a fun list I made up there, I might add changes as I go, but having a written plan makes life much easier for everyone!

My main focus currently will be on finishing some other long-due side projects, courses and books (yes about DSA) because ughhh.. I should be better, stronger...
